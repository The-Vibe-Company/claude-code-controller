# .github/workflows

GitHub Actions CI/CD automation for the-vibe-companion: enforces type safety and test validation on every commit, automates release creation via conventional commits, and publishes to npm registry.

## Contents

### Continuous Integration

**[ci.yml](./ci.yml)** — Triggers on push to `main` and pull requests. Runs `bun install`, `bun run typecheck`, and `bun run test` in `web/` directory on `ubuntu-latest`. Enforces the same checks as the husky pre-commit hook.

### Release & Publish

**[publish.yml](./publish.yml)** — Two-job pipeline triggered on push to `main`. First job runs `googleapis/release-please-action@v4` to analyze conventional commits and create GitHub releases with version bumps. Second job conditionally publishes to npm when `release_created == 'true'`, executing `bun install`, `bun run build`, verifying `dist/index.html` presence, and running `npm publish --access public` with `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`.

## Workflow Dependencies

The `publish` job in publish.yml depends on `release-please` job outputs: `release_created` (boolean) and `tag_name` (string). Both workflows use `oven-sh/setup-bun@v2` for Bun runtime and execute commands in `web/` working directory.

## Integration Points

- **ci.yml** validates the same checks enforced by husky pre-commit hooks (documented in `../CLAUDE.md`)
- **publish.yml** requires `NPM_PUBLISH_TOKEN` secret configured in repository settings
- Both workflows reference `web/package.json` scripts: `typecheck`, `test`, and `build`
